## Features

- Official client for kra.sk online storage
- Open source: Lightweight, clean and secure.
- Material Design: Follows Material Design guidelines, with attention into details.
- Breadcrumbs: Navigate in the filesystem with ease.
- Root support: View and manage files with root access.
- Archive support: View, extract and create common compressed files.
- NAS support: View and manage files on FTP, SFTP, SMB and WebDAV servers.
- Themes: Customizable UI colors, plus night mode with optional true black.
- Linux-aware: Like [Nautilus](https://apps.gnome.org/Nautilus/), knows symbolic links, file permissions and SELinux context.
- Robust: Uses Linux system calls under the hood, not yet another [`ls` parser](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7994720).
- Well-implemented: Built upon the right things, including [Java NIO2 File API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/package-summary.html) and [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata).
